1. Application design and database

Backend Framework & API Design:
The application will be built using FastAPI for high-performance asynchronous request handling.
The FastAPI app will be containerized using Docker and deployed with Kubernetes to support horizontal scalability and orchestration.
Uvicorn will be used to serve the FastAPI app.
NGINX or a cloud-based load balancer (e.g., AWS ALB) will route traffic to the FastAPI app pods.

Database Design:

PostgreSQL will be used as the primary relational database.
Indexes will be added on status and created_at to optimize search and sort operations.
Connection pooling will be implemented using PgBouncer or SQLAlchemy pooling.
Read replicas may be introduced to scale read-heavy workloads.

Scalability:
Horizontal scaling is achieved by deploying multiple FastAPI app instances as Kubernetes pods.
Stateless API design allows seamless horizontal scaling.

Authentication & Authorization:
Keycloak will be used as the identity and access management solution.
OAuth2 Connect will be used for authentication.
Keycloak will manage user roles and permissions (RBAC).
Access tokens (JWT) will be validated in FastAPI routes using middleware or dependencies.


2. Architecture Diagram

The architecture for this FastAPI-based Task Management System is designed to be scalable, secure, and maintainable. Here's how it would be structured:

Users interact with the system via the API, typically using a frontend client or tools like Postman.
All incoming HTTP requests first pass through a Load Balancer (like NGINX). This distributes traffic evenly across multiple instances of the backend service.
The FastAPI application is containerized using Docker and deployed on a Kubernetes cluster. 
Multiple pods of the FastAPI app can be run in parallel to handle high traffic and ensure redundancy. 
The application is stateless, so it scales horizontally easily.
The application communicates with a PostgreSQL database, which stores all task-related data. 
A primary-replica setup may be used to handle large-scale read and write operations efficiently. 
Read replicas improve read performance and reduce load on the primary database.
To optimize performance for frequently accessed data, the system integrates a Redis caching layer. 
The API checks Redis before hitting the database to reduce latency and load.
Background tasks (like sending emails, processing reports, or cleanup jobs) are offloaded to Celery workers. 
These workers fetch tasks from Kafka message queue, allowing the main API to stay responsive and fast.
Authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) are handled by Keycloak, an open-source identity and access management tool. 
Users authenticate through OAuth2, and access tokens are verified by the FastAPI backend. 
Keycloak manages user roles and permissions to protect endpoints.
For observability, tools like Prometheus and Grafana are used for monitoring and dashboards. 
ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) handles centralized logging, making it easier to debug and monitor the application.


3. Caching and Message Queuing

Caching:
Redis will be used to cache frequently accessed task data.
Read-through caching will be implemented:
On a GET /task/{id}, the service will first check Redis.
If a cache hit: return the cached task.
If a cache miss: query the database, return the result, and store it in Redis with a TTL.
Cache will be invalidated or updated when the task is modified or deleted.

Message Queuing:
Celery will be used as the task queue manager with Kafka as the message broker.
Background tasks include:
Sending notifications (e.g., task status change).
Cleaning up old data.
Generating reports asynchronously.
Workers will run in separate containers and scaled independently from the API.
